# easy-segmenter

easy-segmenter is a fast and customizable rule-based sentence segmenter library for Rust.

## Features

- Easy-to-use: easy-segmenter provides pre-defined segmentation rules for supported
  languages such as Japanese.
- Customizable: easy-segmenter provides flexible APIs to define new custom segmentation
  rules.
- Extensible: easy-segmenter is originally designed for Japanese, but it is possible to
  add support for other languages through APIs.
- Self-contained: sentence segmentation is performed solely by segmentation rules
  without relying on external resources.
